# Course-Registation-System
Benchmark for understanding the basic object oriented programming conepts.

Created a course registration system that keeps track of courses in which students are enrolled.
Users are able to create accounts under the Student and Admin classes/inferfaces, granting different permissions based on the type of account created.
Utilized Java's serialization, BufferedReader, and ArrayList libraries to allow user input and keep track of courses.
